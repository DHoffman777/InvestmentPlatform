### ðŸ“Š Key Findings from Trading Service

#### Architecture Patterns
- **EventEmitter-based services** for real-time risk monitoring
- **Express Controllers** with comprehensive validation middleware
- **In-memory data storage** with Map structures (no Prisma)
- **Rate limiting** for API protection

#### Risk Management Components
1. **Settlement Risk Engine**
   - Composite risk scoring
   - Multi-factor risk assessment
   - Real-time risk monitoring

2. **Counterparty Risk**
   - Credit scoring
   - Exposure limits
   - Concentration analysis
   - Industry/country risk weights

3. **Pre-Settlement Checks**
   - 15 different risk check types
   - Dynamic risk limits
   - Compliance rules engine

4. **Failure Prediction**
   - ML-based prediction model
   - Pattern recognition
   - Feature weighting system
   - Model performance tracking

5. **Mitigation Workflows**
   - Automated workflow execution
   - Multi-step escalation
   - Action templates
   - Workflow monitoring

6. **Timeline Tracking**
   - Milestone management
   - SLA monitoring

#### Technical Issues Found
- Uses `require()` for express-validator (CommonJS in TS)
- Type safety issues with route handlers (`as any` casting)
- No actual database persistence (all in-memory)
- Mock implementations for many features

## Next Steps
1. Continue mapping portfolio-service files (49 remaining)
2. Complete market-data service mapping (23 remaining)
3. Map user-service files (14 remaining)
4. Map client-service files (24 remaining)
5. Map remaining infrastructure services (54 remaining)

## Summary
- **Total Files**: 425
- **Mapped**: 73 (17.2%)
- **Remaining**: 352 (82.8%)
- **Estimated Time to 100%**: Need to increase pace significantly
