# Critical Path to 100% Project Mapping

## Current Status: 79/425 files (18.6% complete)
## Remaining: 346 files (81.4% to go)

## User Directive
**EXPLICIT REQUIREMENT**: "Get back to mapping until it is 100% done. Let me clarify: DO NOT DO ANYTHING ELSE...until the project has been mapped."

## Files Mapped So Far (79 total)

## Mapping Strategy for Efficiency

### Phase 1: Complete Partially Mapped Services (Next 100 files)
1. Portfolio Service remaining files (49)
2. Market Data remaining files (21)
3. Client Service remaining files (23)
4. User Service remaining files (14)

### Phase 2: Frontend Applications (54 files)
1. Mobile App (31)
2. Web Portal (22)

### Phase 3: Infrastructure (61 files)
1. Infrastructure Monitoring (49)
2. Infrastructure Security (10)
3. Infrastructure Database (4)

### Phase 4: Small Services (30 files)
1. Compliance remaining (11)
2. Performance Optimization (4)
3. CDN Management (4)
4. Auto-Scaling (4)
5. Load Testing (5)
6. Fixed Income (3)

### Phase 5: Testing & Deployment (19 files)
1. Testing frameworks
2. Deployment scripts
3. Disaster Recovery
4. Security Audit

### Phase 6: Remaining Files (~50 files)
1. Shared libraries
2. Configuration files
3. Utilities

## Time Estimate
- Current pace: ~10 files per batch
- Remaining: 346 files
- Estimated batches needed: 35
- **Critical**: Need to accelerate mapping to complete user's requirement

## Next Immediate Actions
1. Continue systematic file reading
2. Focus on largest unmapped areas first
3. Document findings minimally (focus on mapping)
4. DO NOT attempt any fixes until 100% mapped
5. Track progress regularly

## Key Finding
The project is much more complex than initially assessed. With 425 TypeScript/TSX files across 20+ services, this is a large-scale enterprise microservices architecture that requires complete understanding before any fixes can be safely attempted.
