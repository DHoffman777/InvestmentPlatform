# Investment Platform - Complete Project Mapping
## Total Files: 425 TypeScript/TSX files
## Files Mapped: 95/425 (22.4%)
## Remaining: 330 files (77.6%)

## Architecture Overview

### Core Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js, TypeScript, Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Caching**: Redis with fallback
- **Message Queue**: Kafka (with mock implementation)
- **Frontend Web**: Next.js 14, React, Material-UI
- **Frontend Mobile**: React Native, React Native Paper
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens, MFA support
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics, Winston logging

### Service Architecture Patterns Identified

#### 1. Database Patterns (3 types)
- **Prisma ORM**: Most services use Prisma with PostgreSQL
- **Raw SQL**: Some legacy or performance-critical paths
- **In-Memory**: Trading service uses EventEmitter with Maps

#### 2. Service Implementation Patterns (3 types)
- **Class with DI**: Services like PortfolioService, PositionService
- **Singleton**: Services using getInstance() pattern
- **EventEmitter**: Trading services extend EventEmitter

#### 3. Error Handling Patterns
- Structured error tracking with fingerprinting
- Category-based severity assessment
- Pattern matching for known issues
- Automatic aggregation and reporting

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. Prisma Import Issues (13+ files)

- Should be: `import { Prisma } from '@prisma/client'`
- Use: `new Prisma.Decimal(value)`

### 2. Missing Database Models
- Many services reference models not in schema
- Error, ErrorAggregation tables missing
- Settlement risk tables missing

### 3. Type Safety Issues
- Extensive use of `any` type (500+ instances)
- Missing type definitions for events
- Inconsistent error handling

### 4. Service Pattern Inconsistencies
- Mix of EventEmitter, Singleton, and Class patterns
- Some services have no proper initialization
- Kafka mock vs real implementation unclear

### 5. Module Resolution Issues
- CommonJS require() in TypeScript files
- Missing @types packages
- Path aliases not configured
