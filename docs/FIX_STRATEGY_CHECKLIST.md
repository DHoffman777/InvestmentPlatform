# TypeScript Fix Strategy Checklist & Critical Reminders

## ðŸŽ¯ Primary Objective
Fix ~840 TypeScript compilation errors to achieve successful build while **preserving the institutional-grade business logic** that correctly implements the specifications.

---

## âœ… Things That MUST Happen

### 1. Schema Analysis & Enhancement
- [ ] Map all Prisma models currently defined
- [ ] Identify missing models required by business logic
- [ ] Document field mismatches (e.g., `currentValue` vs `marketValue`)
- [ ] Create migration scripts that preserve existing data
- [ ] Ensure multi-tenant isolation is maintained

### 2. Type System Alignment
- [ ] Map all enum mismatches between Prisma and business logic
- [ ] Ensure consistent casing (lowercase for Prisma enums)
- [ ] Add missing enums (AssetType, RiskLevel, LiquidityTier, etc.)
- [ ] Verify all type imports reference correct Prisma types
- [ ] Fix Decimal type handling (Prisma Decimal vs number conversions)

### 3. Service Dependency Mapping
- [ ] Create complete service dependency graph
- [ ] Identify shared type contracts between services
- [ ] Map data flow between microservices
- [ ] Document Kafka event schemas
- [ ] Ensure consistent API contracts

### 4. Critical Business Logic Preservation
- [ ] Do NOT simplify complex financial calculations
- [ ] Maintain institutional-grade features (structured products, derivatives, etc.)
- [ ] Preserve compliance and regulatory logic
- [ ] Keep multi-asset class support
- [ ] Maintain performance analytics algorithms

### 5. Testing & Validation
- [ ] Verify each fix maintains business logic integrity
- [ ] Test multi-tenant data isolation
- [ ] Validate financial calculations remain accurate
- [ ] Ensure compliance rules still function
- [ ] Check API backwards compatibility

## ðŸ§  Critical Things to Remember

### Architecture Principles
1. **Microservices are domain-driven** - Each service owns its domain logic
2. **Event-driven communication** - Services communicate via Kafka events
3. **Multi-tenant by design** - Every query must respect tenant boundaries
4. **API-first approach** - All functionality exposed via REST APIs
5. **Financial accuracy is paramount** - No rounding errors, precise calculations

### Technical Constraints
1. **Windows PowerShell environment** - User is on Windows, use PowerShell commands
2. **Node.js memory limits** - Use `--max-old-space-size=8192` for builds
3. **Prisma generates types** - After schema changes, must run `npx prisma generate`
4. **Lerna monorepo** - Dependencies between packages must be respected
5. **TypeScript strict mode** - Cannot ignore type safety

### Business Domain Knowledge
1. **Structured Products are complex** - Barriers, autocallables, complex payoffs
2. **Fixed Income requires** - Yield calculations, duration, convexity
3. **Derivatives need Greeks** - Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega calculations
4. **Compliance is non-negotiable** - SEC, FINRA, GDPR requirements
5. **Performance attribution** - Security-level, sector, multi-period analysis

### Previous Lessons Learned
1. **Don't do "whack-a-mole" fixes** - Understand root causes first
2. **Schema is the problem, not business logic** - Business logic correctly implements specs
3. **Type assertions (as any) are band-aids** - Fix the underlying type mismatch
4. **Express middleware needs proper typing** - AuthenticatedRequest interface
5. **Validation middleware syntax** - `param('id').isUUID() as any` not `param('id') as any.isUUID()`

### Error Patterns to Watch For
1. **Missing Prisma models** - AssetClass, InstrumentClassification, etc.
2. **Enum mismatches** - Casing differences, missing values
3. **Field name differences** - Schema vs business logic naming
4. **Missing relations** - Prisma relationships not defined
5. **Decimal type issues** - Prisma Decimal vs JavaScript number
6. **Async/await patterns** - Missing await keywords
7. **Reserved words** - 'yield' in financial contexts

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Discovery & Mapping
- [ ] Complete project file structure mapping
- [ ] Document all service boundaries
- [ ] Identify all Prisma schema files
- [ ] Map business logic to schema requirements
- [ ] Create comprehensive type dependency graph

### Phase 2: Schema Enhancement
- [ ] Design complete Prisma schema
- [ ] Add missing models systematically
- [ ] Create proper relationships
- [ ] Add required enums and types
- [ ] Generate migration scripts

### Phase 3: Code Alignment
- [ ] Update type imports in services
- [ ] Fix field mapping issues
- [ ] Resolve enum references
- [ ] Update validation logic
- [ ] Fix async/await patterns

### Phase 4: Validation
- [ ] Run TypeScript compilation
- [ ] Verify error count reduction
- [ ] Test critical business logic
- [ ] Validate API contracts
- [ ] Check multi-tenant isolation

## ðŸš« What NOT to Do

1. **DON'T simplify business logic** - It's correct per specifications
2. **DON'T use extensive type assertions** - Fix root cause instead
3. **DON'T ignore financial precision** - Decimal handling is critical
4. **DON'T break multi-tenant isolation** - Security is paramount
5. **DON'T skip Prisma regeneration** - After schema changes
6. **DON'T assume file paths** - User's environment may differ
7. **DON'T create files unnecessarily** - Edit existing when possible

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics

- [ ] 0 TypeScript compilation errors
- [ ] All services build successfully
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] API contracts maintained
- [ ] Financial calculations accurate
- [ ] Multi-tenant isolation verified
- [ ] Performance requirements met
